# xcb_demo

I compile these on RaspBian "jessie" with
gcc -l xcb colordemo.c -o colordemo
Of course the required packages need to be installed, to begin with libxcb1-dev

The reason I started this little project is that I didn't find an example of showing text in colour,
and what I found was complicated, or outright confusing.
